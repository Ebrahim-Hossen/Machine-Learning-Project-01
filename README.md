# Machine-Learning-Project-01

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). This first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The first case of COVID-19 was detected on 8th March 2020 in Bangladesh. Subsequently, COVID-19 cases have been increasing at an alarming rate in Bangladesh because of the high-density population with limited resources. However, to protect against this type of disaster there is an urgent need for high-quality data and forecasting for national preparedness and action plans, which is currently unavailable. Therefore, we developed a machine learning-based project that provides us with trend analysis and predicts the likely number of cases and deaths in upcoming days, Distributed Bangladesh in different zone according to the number of cases to increase people's awareness, finding the correlation between coronavirus and any other disease. For this investigation, we applied linear regression, polynomial regression, Extra Tree Classifier, Decision Tree Regression, and chi-square test machine learning algorithm with high and best accuracy.
